Enhanced BMI Calculator
The BMI Calculator is a web application designed to help users calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) and understand their weight category based on the BMI value. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input their age, gender, height, and weight. Once the user inputs the required details and clicks the "Calculate" button, the application calculates the BMI and displays the result along with a weight category. Additionally, a dynamic chart visualizes the user's BMI in comparison to standard BMI categories, providing a comprehensive understanding of their health status.

Technologies Used
HTML: The structure of the BMI Calculator is built using HTML. It defines the layout of the input fields, labels, buttons, and other elements on the webpage.
CSS: The styling of the application is done using CSS, which ensures the page is visually appealing and responsive. The CSS handles the layout, colors, fonts, and overall design of the calculator.
JavaScript: The functionality of the BMI Calculator is powered by JavaScript. It performs the BMI calculation based on user input, updates the webpage with the results, and renders the chart using the Chart.js library.

Features
User Input Fields: Allows users to input their age, gender, height (in cm), and weight (in kg).
BMI Calculation: Calculates the BMI using the formula: BMI = weight / (height/100 * height/100).
Result Display: Displays the calculated BMI value and the corresponding weight category (Underweight, Healthy, Overweight, Obese).
Dynamic Chart: Visualizes the user's BMI in comparison to standard BMI categories, providing a clear visual representation of the user's health status.
Responsive Design: Ensures the application is accessible and functional on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
This project showcases the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a useful and interactive web application that helps users monitor their health. The use of Chart.js enhances the user experience by providing a visual context to the BMI values.
