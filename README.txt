TODO List
This project is a simple TODO List web application that allows users to add, view, and delete items from a list. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the project's components:

HTML
The index.html file defines the structure of the web application. It includes:

Header: Contains the navigation bar with links to Home, About, and Contact, along with a search input field and a search button.
Main Content: Includes a form to add items to the TODO list, with fields for the title and description of each item, and buttons to add items and clear the list.
Table: Displays the list of items added by the user, with each item having a title, description, and a delete button.
Footer: Displays a simple footer with copyright information.
CSS
The style.css file provides styling for the HTML elements, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing layout. It includes:

Global Styles: Resets default margins and paddings, and sets box-sizing.
Layout: Defines the overall structure of the page using flexbox, with a header, main content area, and footer.
Form and Table Styles: Styles the form controls and table elements to ensure they are visually appealing and easy to use.
JavaScript
The index.js file contains the logic for managing the TODO list. It includes:

Add Item: Adds a new item to the list and stores it in the browser's local storage.
Populate List: Retrieves items from local storage and displays them in the table.
Delete Item: Removes an item from the list and updates local storage.
Clear Storage: Clears all items from the list and local storage.
This project demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using local storage for data persistence, and showcases the use of modern web development technologies to create a functional and interactive application.
